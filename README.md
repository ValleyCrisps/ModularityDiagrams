## TODO

From Mathologer original wishlist
- [ ] Being able to color line segments according to length.
- [ ] Indication of the "direction" of multiplication. 1x2 = 2 and so there should really be a little arrow from 1 to 2 not just a simple connection :)
- [ ] different loops in different colors.

From me
- [ ] static page hosting
- [ ] user input for the modulus
- [ ] option to see the animation(s)
- [ ] single loop or all loops option
- [ ] dark mode
- [ ] typescript
- [ ] slider for factor
